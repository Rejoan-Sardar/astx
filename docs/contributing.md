# Contributing Guideline

The projetc uses the _monorepo_ approach, so the libraries are stored at
**libs/astx**, and **libs/astx-transpilers**.

In order to be able to contribute, it is important that you understand the
project layout. This project uses the _src layout_, which means that the package
code is main located at `./libs/astx/src/astx` and
`./libs/astx-transpilers/src/astx`.

For more information, check the official documentation:
https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/discussions/src-layout-vs-flat-layout/

In addition, you should know that to build our package we use
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), it's a Python package management tool that
simplifies the process of building and publishing Python packages. It allows us
to easily manage dependencies, virtual environments and package versions. Poetry
also includes features such as dependency resolution, lock files and publishing
to PyPI. Overall, Poetry streamlines the process of managing Python packages,
making it easier for us to create and share our code with others.

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every little bit
helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

## Types of Contributions

### Report Bugs

Report bugs at https://github.com/arxlang/astx/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

- Your operating system name and version.
- Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
- Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

### Fix Bugs

Look through the GitHub issues for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help
wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Implement Features

Look through the GitHub issues for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement"
and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants to implement it.

### Write Documentation

ASTx could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official ASTx
docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/arxlang/astx/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

- Explain in detail how it would work.
- Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
- Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions are
  welcome :)

## Get Started!

Ready to contribute? Here’s how to set up `astx` for local development.

1.  Fork the `astx` repo on GitHub.
2.  Clone your fork locally:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/astx.git
$ cd astx/
```

3.  Create a new virtual environment and install your local copy into that:

```bash
# note: you can use mamba or conda or micromamba
$ mamba env create --file conda/dev.yaml
$ conda activate astx
$ poetry install
```

4.  Create a branch for local development:

```bash
$ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
# Now you can make your changes locally.
```

5.  When you’re done making changes, check that your changes pass the linter and
    the tests:

```bash
$ makim tests.linter
$ makim tests.unit
```

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
$ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
```

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

## Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1.  The pull request should include tests.
2.  If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put your
    new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the feature to
    the list in README.rst.
3.  The pull request should work for Python >= 3.8.

## Tips

To run a subset of tests, you can use something like:

```bash
$ pytest tests.test_arxast
```

or

```bash
$ makim tests.unit --path "tests/test_arxast" --params "-k mytest_func"
```

## Release

This project uses semantic-release in order to cut a new release based on the
commit-message.

### Commit message format

**semantic-release** uses the commit messages to determine the consumer impact
of changes in the codebase. Following formalized conventions for commit
messages, **semantic-release** automatically determines the next
[semantic version](https://semver.org) number, generates a changelog and
publishes the release.

By default, **semantic-release** uses
[Angular Commit Message Conventions](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).
The commit message format can be changed with the `preset` or `config` options\_
of the
[@semantic-release/commit-analyzer](https://github.com/semantic-release/commit-analyzer#options)
and
[@semantic-release/release-notes-generator](https://github.com/semantic-release/release-notes-generator#options)
plugins.

Tools such as [commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli) or
[commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) can be used
to help contributors and enforce valid commit messages.

The table below shows which commit message gets you which release type when
`semantic-release` runs (using the default configuration):

| Commit message                                                 | Release type     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `fix(pencil): stop graphite breaking when pressure is applied` | Fix Release      |
| `feat(pencil): add 'graphiteWidth' option`                     | Feature Release  |
| `perf(pencil): remove graphiteWidth option`                    | Chore            |
| `feat(pencil)!: The graphiteWidth option has been removed`     | Breaking Release |

_NOTE: Breaking change's commit message prefix should have `!` before `:`_.
Also, ensure to specify `feat` or `fix` in the prefix.

This project uses the `squash and merge` strategy, so ensure to apply the commit
message format to the PR's title.
